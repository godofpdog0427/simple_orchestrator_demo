# Research

## Overview
Systematic approach to gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information from web sources.

## When to Use
- Learning new technologies or libraries
- Comparing different approaches
- Finding documentation or examples
- Investigating errors or issues

## Research Process

### 1. Define Scope
- Clearly identify the research question
- Determine required depth
- Set time/resource limits

### 2. Gather Information
- Start with official documentation
- Check authoritative sources (MDN, RFCs, official repos)
- Look for recent, maintained resources
- Consider multiple perspectives

### 3. Evaluate Sources
- Check publication date (prefer recent)
- Verify author credibility
- Look for citations/references
- Cross-reference multiple sources

### 4. Synthesize
- Identify common themes
- Note contradictions or controversies
- Extract actionable insights
- Organize findings logically

## Source Priority

1. **Official Documentation**: Primary reference
2. **RFCs/Specifications**: For standards and protocols
3. **Official GitHub/GitLab**: Source code and issues
4. **Stack Overflow**: Practical solutions (verify answer date)
5. **Blog Posts**: Use with caution, verify claims
6. **Social Media**: Lowest priority, verify elsewhere

## Quality Indicators

### ✅ High Quality
- Official or authoritative source
- Recent publication date
- Clear, well-structured content
- Includes examples and code
- Has citations or references
- Active maintenance

### ❌ Low Quality
- No author information
- Outdated (>2 years for fast-moving tech)
- Contradicts official docs
- No examples or vague explanations
- Abandoned projects
- Obvious errors or typos

## Research Templates

### API Research
1. Official API documentation
2. Rate limits and quotas
3. Authentication methods
4. Example requests/responses
5. Error handling
6. SDKs or client libraries

### Library Evaluation
1. Maintenance status (last commit, open issues)
2. Documentation quality
3. Community size
4. License compatibility
5. Dependencies and bundle size
6. Alternatives comparison

### Error Investigation
1. Exact error message search
2. Check official issue tracker
3. Stack Overflow recent solutions
4. Related GitHub issues
5. Version-specific considerations

## Best Practices

- **Verify Claims**: Don't trust single sources for critical decisions
- **Check Dates**: Prefer recent content for evolving technologies
- **Read Comments**: On Stack Overflow, blog posts - they often contain important caveats
- **Test Examples**: Don't assume code snippets work without verification
- **Document Sources**: Keep track of useful references for future use
